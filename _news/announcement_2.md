## Key Achievements

- **500+ downloads** across 25+ countries
- **Municipal integration** with local planning workflows  
- **Community contributions** and valuable user feedback
- **Featured presentation** at FOSS4G 2023 conference in Prizren, Kosovo
- **Open-source impact** with contributions from international developers

## Technical Highlights

The plugin has evolved significantly since its initial release:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Automated geometry generation</strong> with customizable offset distances</li>
    <li><strong>Accessibility compliance</strong> with OpenStreetMap tagging standards</li>
    <li><strong>Batch processing</strong> capabilities for city-wide mapping projects</li>
    <li><strong>Quality assurance</strong> tools for data validation</li>
</ul>

## Community Impact
