I am **Kauê de Moraes Vestena**, a PhD candidate in Geodetic Sciences at the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR). My work centres on accessibility mapping using open data and open tools, with a particular focus on mapping sidewalk networks in OpenStreetMap【818070301618945†L156-L162】. I develop open‑source software to support inclusive mobility, including the **OSM SidewalKreator** QGIS plugin【490715376250272†L26-L33】, and contribute to projects such as **OpenSidewalkMap** to create comprehensive pedestrian network inventories.

I earned my Master’s degree in Geodetic Sciences (2017–2020) and my undergraduate degree in Cartographic and Surveying Engineering (2012–2017) from UFPR【792472231477661†L69-L76】. Before university I trained as a Surveying technician at UTFPR (2009–2012)【792472231477661†L69-L76】. Outside of research, I enjoy hiking, travelling and exploring maps.

### Research interests

- **Accessibility mapping and inclusive mobility**【818070301618945†L156-L162】  
  Studying how open data can inform inclusive urban planning, with a focus on sidewalk networks and pedestrian accessibility.
- **Geospatial data science**【792472231477661†L69-L76】  
  Applying terrestrial mobile mapping, remote sensing and cartographic techniques to extract meaningful insights from spatial data.
- **OpenStreetMap and collaborative cartography**【818070301618945†L156-L162】  
  Developing tools and methodologies that enhance community‑driven mapping efforts.
