I am **Kauê de Moraes Vestena**, a PhD candidate in Geodetic Sciences at the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR). My work centres on accessibility mapping using open data and open tools, with a particular focus on mapping sidewalk networks in OpenStreetMap【818070301618945†L156-L162】. I develop open‑source software to support inclusive mobility and collaborated on the **OSM SidewalKreator** QGIS plugin, which automates drawing of sidewalks based on OSM street networks【490715376250272†L26-L33】.

I earned my Master’s degree in Geodetic Sciences (2017–2020) and my undergraduate degree in Cartographic and Surveying Engineering (2012–2017) from UFPR【792472231477661†L69-L76】. Before university I trained as a Surveying technician at UTFPR (2009–2012)【792472231477661†L69-L76】. When I’m not coding or mapping, I enjoy hiking and exploring maps.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you’d like to collaborate.
