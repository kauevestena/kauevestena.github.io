Over the last few years I have been developing and contributing to a number of open‑source tools that advance accessibility mapping and collaborative cartography. Below are some of the key projects I maintain or contribute to.

## OSM SidewalKreator【490715376250272†L26-L33】

A QGIS plugin that automatically generates sidewalk geometries from OpenStreetMap street data. It streamlines the tedious process of drawing pedestrian networks and helps populate OSM with comprehensive sidewalk information.

## OpenSidewalkMap【818070301618945†L156-L162】

An initiative to create a comprehensive inventory and visualisation of pedestrian networks using OpenStreetMap data. The goal is to make accessibility information more readily available to researchers, planners and the general public.

## Teaching & outreach

I regularly contribute to workshops and courses on geospatial data science and OpenStreetMap. If you're interested in inviting me for a talk or collaboration, please get in touch.
